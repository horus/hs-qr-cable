# hs-qr-cable

**DISCLAIMER**: Don't take it seriously, super low quality code that not even necessarily correct. To show some hints for the one who's curious, I left it here.

## What's this?

This tool decodes the QR code generated by browsers when login with Passkeys.
But it won't decode the QR code itself, you need another one, such as [this](https://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx).

This new specification will likely to be called "CTAP 2.2", ~~and will be published as a draft [soon](https://groups.google.com/a/fidoalliance.org/g/fido-dev/c/oTiO9SBl08o/m/TUSv4neVAAAJ).~~ **The wait is over**: [Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP)
Review Draft, March 21, 2023](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.2-rd-20230321/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.2-rd-20230321.html).

While I've added the basic ability to connect to the tunnel servers, it never really worked with Apple's. And I've found the reason in the draft:

> The protocol between the authenticator and the tunnel service, and details about how the service later contacts the authenticator, are a private detail of the authenticator's implementation.

## Where...I don't...

For convenience I built 2 binaries.
